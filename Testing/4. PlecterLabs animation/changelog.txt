v0.1 - Integrated Animation code from the Plecterlabs sketch to my own sketch. This made it easier to learn 
	   about Erv's animation coding.
	   Removed serial communication code from Plecterlabs sketch and added my buttoncontrol code to replace it.

------------------------------------------------	   
v0.2.0 - Tried triggering audio from the 'ParseSyntax' function, worked but audio was slowed very much in 	 
		 combination with the c-ring animation. Conversely for the blade it slowed down the blade animation but not the audio.
		 
v0.2.1 - Tried triggering audio from the 'Animate' function.
	     Doesn't work correctly, C-ring animation stops after second segment. Audio plays fine though but 
		 the Arduino (sketch) seizes up. Nothing else responds anymore.
		 Conversely when uploading the sketch again and trying the blade animation only one NeoPixel lights up, after that the animation fails but the audio track is played correctly.

Created Visio flow diagram to get a better understanding of the animation code(functions), how they work an tigh together.
May need a secondary board to control the NeoPixels and have the M0 only control the Music Maker.
Serial communication can be used between boards. This would make Bluetooth an option again.

v0.2.2 - Rearanged animation functions.
		 Copied c-ring animation trigger from the "ParseSyntax" function to the "Void loop". c-ring boot animation is now triggerd upon disc powerup.

v0.2.3 - Continued work on triggering sound effects together with the animations.
         Triggering the audio file from the "void setup" sections works. C-ring animation + audio works now, however, playing audio still slows down the animation.
		 
v0.2.4 - Triggering blade audio from the "ParseSyntax" function again. Works but still slows the animation from this point.
		 Also included blade deactivation sound from Saberfront Audio font package by Novastar.
		 // Apparantly the Music Maker audio triggers only seem to work okay when triggered in setup (void setup).
